# NUT-08 Lightning Fee Return Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete

This document summarizes the successful implementation of **NUT-08: Lightning fee return** specification in the cashu-nip60 codebase.

## What is NUT-08?

NUT-08 is the Cashu specification that defines how overpaid Lightning fees should be returned to users instead of being kept by the mint. This improves fee efficiency and user experience when making Lightning payments.

### The Problem
Previously, when paying Lightning invoices:
- Wallets had to provide a `fee_reserve` upfront (e.g., 1000 sats)
- If actual Lightning fees were lower (e.g., 100 sats), the mint kept the difference (900 sats)
- Users lost money on every Lightning payment due to overpaid fees

### The Solution: Blank Outputs
NUT-08 introduces "blank outputs" - blinded messages that can receive the overpaid fee difference:
- Wallet provides blank outputs alongside the payment
- Mint assigns overpaid fees to these blank outputs
- Wallet receives back the difference as new ecash tokens

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Added Blank Outputs Calculation**
   ```python
   def _calculate_blank_outputs_needed(self, fee_reserve: int) -> int:
       """Calculate number per NUT-08: max(ceil(log2(fee_reserve)), 1)"""
       if fee_reserve <= 0:
           return 0
       return max(math.ceil(math.log2(fee_reserve)), 1)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Melt Request**
   - Generates both wallet change outputs AND blank outputs
   - Sends combined outputs array to mint
   - Properly tracks all blinding factors

3. **Advanced Change Processing**
   - Separates wallet change from Lightning fee returns
   - Maps returned signatures to correct blinding factors
   - Handles NUT-08 signature ordering requirements

4. **Full Specification Compliance**
   - Implements all NUT-08 requirements
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Ready for NUT-08 compatible mints

### ✅ Testing & Verification

Created comprehensive test suite verifying:
- Blank outputs calculation accuracy
- NUT-08 specification examples  
- Edge cases and error handling
- Integration requirements

Example test results:
```
fee_reserve=1000 → 10 blank outputs ✅ (matches spec example)
fee_reserve=100  → 7 blank outputs  ✅ 
fee_reserve=4    → 2 blank outputs  ✅
fee_reserve=1    → 1 blank output   ✅
fee_reserve=0    → 0 blank outputs  ✅
```

## Benefits for Users

### 💰 Money Saved
- **Before**: Pay 1000 sat fee reserve, lose 900 sats if actual fee was 100 sats
- **After**: Pay 1000 sat fee reserve, get 900 sats back as new tokens

### ⚡ Better Lightning Experience  
- More predictable costs
- Transparent fee handling
- No more "fee sink" effect

### 🔄 Automatic Operation
- Works automatically with NUT-08 compatible mints
- Falls back gracefully for older mints
- No user action required

## Technical Architecture

### Files Modified

**`sixty_nuts/wallet.py`**
- Added `_calculate_blank_outputs_needed()` method (lines ~134-146)
- Updated `melt()` method with blank outputs logic (lines ~1620-1750)
- Enhanced change processing for fee returns
- Added required math import

**`tests/test_nut08_implementation.py`** (NEW)
- Complete test coverage for NUT-08 functionality
- Verification against specification examples
- Edge case testing and validation

## Example: How It Works

### Before NUT-08
```
Invoice: 10,000 sats
Fee reserve: 1,000 sats
Total sent: 11,000 sats

Actual Lightning fee: 100 sats
User loses: 900 sats (kept by mint)
```

### After NUT-08  
```
Invoice: 10,000 sats
Fee reserve: 1,000 sats  
Total sent: 11,000 sats + 10 blank outputs

Actual Lightning fee: 100 sats
Overpaid amount: 900 sats
Returned as tokens: 900 sats (via blank outputs)
User loses: 0 sats ✅
```

## Compatibility

### ✅ Backward Compatible
- Existing wallets continue working
- No breaking API changes
- Optional enhancement

### ✅ Forward Compatible  
- Ready for NUT-08 mints
- Implements latest specification
- Future-proof design

- **Enable feature**: Start returning overpaid fees to users

### For Developers
- **Review implementation**: All code is documented and tested
- **Extend functionality**: Build upon this NUT-08 foundation
- **Contribute**: Submit improvements or additional NUT implementations

## Conclusion

✅ **NUT-08 Lightning fee return is now fully implemented**

This implementation represents a significant step forward in Cashu wallet efficiency and user experience. Users will automatically benefit from returned Lightning fees when using compatible mints, while maintaining full backward compatibility.

The implementation follows the NUT-08 specification exactly and includes comprehensive testing to ensure correctness and reliability.

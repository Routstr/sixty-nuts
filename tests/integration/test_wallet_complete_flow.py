"""Complete wallet flow integration tests.

Tests the full wallet functionality against real mint and relay infrastructure.
Only runs when RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS environment variable is set.

Rate Limiting Handling:
- Uses get_relay_wait_time() to apply 3x longer waits for public relays
- Implements exponential backoff and retry logic for heavily rate-limited operations
- Adds delays between test classes and methods to space out relay operations
- Uses longer timeouts for public relay operations vs local services
